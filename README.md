#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
=
var: Functionality, take care to redeclare, allow for updates.

const: Functionality as above cannot be updated or redeclared. 

#### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?

forEach(): Just loops over items and doesnâ€™t return a new array.

filter(): Returns a new array with items that pass a condition.  


#### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?

#### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

like:
const [a, b] = [10, 20];   when a=10, b=20                             
const {name, age} = {name:"Tom", age:25};  


#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
